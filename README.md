# 📰 Fake News Detector



An AI-powered web application built with a fine-tuned DistilBERT model to classify news articles as REAL or FAKE. This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data cleaning and model training to deployment as an interactive app using Streamlit.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive UI**: A clean and simple user interface built with Streamlit.

- **AI-Powered Classification**: Utilizes a powerful `DistilBERT` model fine-tuned on a large dataset of news articles.

- **Real-time Predictions**: Paste any news article and get an instant prediction with a corresponding confidence score.

- **Data Leakage Prevention**: The training process specifically addresses and cleans data leakage issues for a more robust and reliable model.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend & Modeling**: Python, PyTorch, Transformers (Hugging Face), Scikit-learn, Pandas

- **Frontend & Deployment**: Streamlit, Streamlit Community Cloud

- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, Git LFS

## 🚀 Running Locally

To run this project on your own machine, follow these steps:



1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash

   git clone [https://github.com/Shiva2806/Fake-News-Detector.git](https://github.com/Shiva2806/Fake-News-Detector.git)

   cd Fake-News-Detector

   ```



2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash

   python -m venv venv

   ```



3. **Activate the environment:**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash

     .\venv\Scripts\activate

     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash

     source venv/bin/activate

     ```



4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```



5. **Run the Streamlit app:**

   ```bash

   streamlit run app.py

   ```

   The application should open in your web browser.



##  Acknowledgments

The training data for this model is primarily based on a public Kaggle dataset containing real and fake news. To enhance the model's robustness, this was augmented with a manually curated dataset of 1,000 additional articles (500 real and 500 fake).
